### Experience

I graduated from the *University of Maryland* with a double degree in Electrical Engineering and 
Mathematics. My focus was on Signal Processing and Machine Learning, which I got a little research experience in. 

Since then, I have worked at *Apple* as a software engineer on the 
Apple Music Android app. 


### Interests

I'm currently interested in solidifying my technical foundation by reading textbooks on subjects I never got the chance to study in depth, like _Operating Systems_ and _Java Internals_.

In my free time I watch a lot of sci-fi shows and movies, and I am the forever GM in my friends' DND campaign.
